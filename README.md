# C Programming #

* C has been called a **systems programming** language.
* Writing compilers and operating systems (**low level**).
* Used to write major programs as well.
* Learning DS&A is usefule for implementing programs and applications 
  efficiently.
* Can perform **macro substitution** in preprocessing step.
* C is **low level**:
    * Deals with **characters, numbers, and addresses**.
    * Same objects that most computers do.
    * Does not deal with **composite objects**.
    * No heap or garbage collection.
    * Small language, its entirety can be learned relatively quickly.

* **THERE IS NO INPUT OR OUTPUT** in C.
* `printf` is defined at the OS standard library level.
* All **I/O** is defined by the standard library, not by the language itself.


## Compilation ##
* Different from interpretation, a copy of the working program is always
  available.
* Programmer can edit the program as much as he wants, without affecting
  the working copy of the program.
